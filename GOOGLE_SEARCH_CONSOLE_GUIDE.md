# Google Search Console Setup & Optimization Guide
## For Joe's Used Harleys - Updated January 2025

This guide walks you through submitting your new pages to Google and monitoring your SEO performance.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Access Google Search Console

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Log in with your Google account (the one tied to joesusedharleys.com)
3. Select your property: `https://www.joesusedharleys.com`

---

## 📊 Step 2: Submit Your New Sitemap

### Option A: Submit New Sitemap (Recommended)
1. In left sidebar, click **"Sitemaps"**
2. In the "Add a new sitemap" field, enter: `sitemap-2025.xml`
3. Click **"SUBMIT"**
4. Wait 24-48 hours for Google to process

### Option B: Keep Both Sitemaps
- Your old sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) is still valid
- The new one (`sitemap-2025.xml`) includes all new state pages and blog posts
- Google will crawl both automatically

**Result:** Google will discover:
- 7 new state pages (WI, IL, MI, MN, IA, IN, OH)
- 4 new blog posts (+ more coming)
- Updated city/model pages
- All existing content

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Request Indexing for Priority Pages

For immediate indexing of your most important new pages:

1. In left sidebar, click **"URL Inspection"**
2. Enter each URL below (one at a time)
3. Click **"REQUEST INDEXING"**
4. Wait for confirmation (usually 1-2 days)

### **Priority URLs to Index First:**

#### State Pages (Highest Priority):
```
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/used-harleys-state/wisconsin
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/used-harleys-state/illinois
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/used-harleys-state/michigan
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/used-harleys-state/ohio
```

#### New Blog Posts:
```
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/blog/bad-credit-harley-financing-actually-works
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/blog/used-harley-pre-purchase-inspection-checklist
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/blog/harley-davidson-touring-bikes-comparison-guide
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/blog/how-many-miles-too-many-used-harley
```

```
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/blog
https://www.joesusedharleys.com/contact

```

**Note:** Don't request indexing for ALL pages at once - Google limits requests. Do 10-15 per day.

## 📈 Step 4: Monitor Performance

### Check Coverage Report
1. Click **"Coverage"** in left sidebar
2. Look for:
   - **Valid pages** (should be 100+ after sitemap processes)
   - **Errors** (should be 0 - fix any errors immediately)
   - **Excluded pages** (normal for some pages)

### Monitor Search Performance
1. Click **"Performance"** in left sidebar
2. Track these metrics weekly:
   - **Total clicks** (increasing = good)
   - **Total impressions** (shows visibility)
   - **Average CTR** (aim for 3-5%+)
   - **Average position** (lower number = better)

### Top Queries to Watch:
After 2-4 weeks, check if you're ranking for:
- "used harleys [your state]"
- "used harley davidson [city]"
- "bad credit harley financing"
- "used harley shipping"
- "[model name] for sale"

## 🛠️ Step 5: Fix Common Issues

### Issue: "Discovered - Currently not indexed"
**Solution:** 
1. Check if page has quality content (300+ words)
2. Make sure it's linked from other pages
3. Request indexing manually
4. Wait 1-2 weeks

### Issue: "Crawled - Currently not indexed"
**Solution:**
1. Check for duplicate content
2. Improve page quality/uniqueness
3. Add more internal links to the page
4. Wait and monitor

### Issue: "Page with redirect"
**Solution:**
1. Check if redirect is intentional
2. Update sitemap to remove redirected URLs
3. Use 301 redirects (permanent) not 302 (temporary)

### Issue: "Soft 404"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure page returns proper 404 code if deleted
2. Or add real content if page should exist
3. Remove from sitemap if permanently deleted

## 🎯 Step 6: Optimize for Featured Snippets

Your new content is optimized for featured snippets (Position 0). Monitor these:

1. Go to **Performance** > **Search results**
2. Filter by **"Search appearance"** > **"Featured snippets"**
3. Track which pages get featured snippets
4. Create more similar content

**Pages likely to get snippets:**
