# Airtable Base vs. Build an App - Which Should You Use?

## TL;DR: **Use the Base/Table Interface** ✅

For your bike inventory, you should use the **regular Airtable base/table interface** (what we set up). You don't need to "Build an app" - that's for more complex workflows.

## What's the Difference?

### Option 1: Airtable Base/Table (What We Set Up) ✅ RECOMMENDED

### Option 2: "Build an App" (Airtable Interface Designer)

**What it is:**
- Airtable's custom interface builder
- Lets you create custom forms, views, and workflows
- More like building a mini app inside Airtable

**Pros:**
- Custom branded interface
- Can create forms for customers
- More advanced workflows

**Cons:**
- ❌ **More complex** - Steeper learning curve
- ❌ **Overkill** - You don't need this for simple inventory
- ❌ **Takes longer** - More setup time
- ❌ **Still uses the same base** - Doesn't change how your site works

**Best for:**
- Complex workflows
- Customer-facing forms
- When you need custom branding inside Airtable

## My Recommendation: **Stick with the Base/Table Interface**

Here's why:

1. **You already have it set up** - Your Next.js site is configured to work with the base interface
2. **It's simpler** - Just add rows, fill in columns, upload images
3. **It's faster** - No need to learn a new interface
4. **It works perfectly** - The base interface does everything you need

## What You Should Do:

1. **Use the regular Airtable base** (what we set up)
2. **Add bikes** by clicking "+" and filling in the columns
3. **Upload images** by dragging them into the Image column
4. **That's it!** Your site will automatically show the bikes

## When Would You Use "Build an App"?

Only use "Build an App" if you want to:
- Create a custom form for customers to submit trade-ins
- Build a custom dashboard with charts
- Create a branded interface for your team
- Add complex workflows and automations

**For just managing inventory?** The base interface is perfect.

## Bottom Line

**Don't build an app.** Just use the Airtable base/table interface we set up. It's:
- ✅ Easier
- ✅ Faster
- ✅ Already working
- ✅ Perfect for your needs

Your Next.js site pulls data from the base, so whether you use the base interface or build an app, your site works the same way. The base interface is just simpler to use.
